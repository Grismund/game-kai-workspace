# Kai's Workspace Project
It's your first case. A friend of a friend has gone missing. She's an amateur photographer who didn't come home last night.
The police can't do much until 24 hours have passed. But you're no cop, thank God.

You need to examine the scene, find clues, and bring Kai home safely...if you can.

- set your iOS simulator to iPhone (tested at iOS 16.4)
- This project is not built to run on Android

## Goals
### Mastery Level
I currently have two growth goals in the Investment Program. For each, I need to attain a mastery level of "Practicing (10%-40%)."

What does "Practicing 10%-40%" mean?

"Ranging from being personally aware of the skill/behavior in an advanced depth and my growith is consistent over a period to I am well aware of the skill/behavior and how to do it in my sphere shown by multiple periods of consistency. I am confident in the "what" and "how" but developing the "when" and "where" of this behavior/skill."

### Skill to Practice
My main growth goals in the Investment Program right now are:
1. Practicing (10%-40%): Confident in making changes in an existing codebase /feature or other's code.
2. Practicing (10%-40%): Confident to begin a green field codebase/feature. Knows how to start from New.

### How the Project Helps
This project served several purposes:
- Learn the fundamentals of Xamarin.Forms through various controls and layouts
  - Button
  - Picker
  - Modal
  - Grid
  - ListView with DataTemplate
  - `ObservableCollection`
- Learn SQLite + Xamarin.Forms
  - Implement a SQLite database
  - Read/Write to the database through the UI
- Reinforce the fundamentals of MVVM
  - Implement a simple MVVM pattern
  - Implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`

These all help be to be more confident in making changes in an existing code base and green-fielding a new project.

## Tech Design
### Documentation
The major design decisions are laid out in a living document which guided the process.
